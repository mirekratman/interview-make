# Estimations

I'm adding time estimation based on functionality.
Please consider estimation in MD (man days), but please take on mind I need to switch context everyday between 3 projects and handle still some interviews. I need to finish one bigger topic for Czech News Center (current company, with deadline) as also I agreed for a trial task with another company who already offered me a fulltime job and the project they are working on is almost ideally aligned with my extensive experience with CMS systems.

Please also take on mind that I will be delivering the solution piece-by-piece, meaning some code that was created still could be changed a bit. I will use versioned branches for that.
I will also provide updates in this DOC.

## 1. App structure - 3.5 MD

1.1. Optimize file structure
1.2. Setup docker compose for local dev
1.3. Setup API express framework
1.4. Prepare seed script
1.5. Prepare basic CI/CD
1.6. Add API auth
1.7. Handle CSRF
1.8. Prepare basic DOC

## 2. API Endpoints - 1.5 MD

2.1. Upload
2.2. Extend upload for multiple files
2.3. Handle max size

## 3. API memory leak - 0.5 MD

3.1. Verify session storage. Propose solution

## 4. Tests - 1 MD

4.1. Example unit tests

## 5. DOCs, fixes - 1 MD

5.1. Extend docs

In case it will go faster that expected I will make a simple React APP for FE tasks
