# Estimations

I'm adding time estimation based on functionality.
Please consider estimation in MD (man days), but please take on mind I need to switch context everyday between 3 projects and handle still some interviews. I need to finish one bigger topic for Czech News Center (current company, with deadline) as also I agreed for a trial task with another company who already offered me a fulltime job and the project they are working on is almost ideally aligned with my extensive experience with CMS systems.

Please also take on mind that I will be delivering the solution piece-by-piece, meaning some code that was created still could be changed a bit. I will use versioned branches for that.
I will also provide updates in this DOC.

1. App structure - 3.5 MD

-   Optimize file structure
-   Setup docker compose for local dev
-   Setup API express framework
-   Prepare seed script
-   Prepare basic CI/CD
-   Add API auth
-   Handle CSRF
-   Prepare basic DOC

2. API Endpoints - 1.5 MD

-   Upload
-   Extend upload for multiple files
-   Handle max size

3. API memory leak - 0.5 MD

-   Verify session storage. Propose solution

4. Tests - 1 MD

-   Example unit tests

5. DOCs, fixes - 1 MD

-   Extend docs
-   Post fixes

6. FE APP - TBE (To Be Estimated)

In case it will go faster that expected I will make a simple React APP for FE tasks
